# Remove `tip` from tutor JSON and UI output

**Date:** 2026-02-20 22:24
**Files:** src/Services/OpenAIService.php, src/Controllers/ApiController.php, public/assets/app.js
**Severity:** low

## Problem

Tutor responses included a separate `tip` field that user found distracting.

## Root Cause

The prompt explicitly required `reply, tip`, backend exposed `feedback.tip`, and frontend rendered it as an extra chat message.

## Solution

- Changed prompt contract to strict JSON with only `reply`.
- Removed `tip` parsing from `OpenAIService::tutorReply`.
- Removed `feedback.tip` from `/api/chat` response payload.
- Removed frontend rendering of tip message.

## Prevention

- Keep response schema minimal and user-validated.
- When changing model output contract, update prompt/backend/frontend together in one commit.
