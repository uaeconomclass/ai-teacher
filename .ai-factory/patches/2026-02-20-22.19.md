**Severity:** low

## Problem

Sidebar contained a static block (`Mode`, `Focus`, topic chips, and hint text) that was considered unnecessary for the current UI and added visual noise.

## Root Cause

The landing sidebar mixed branding with onboarding helper content. As product direction shifted, the helper content was no longer needed but remained in template, JS bindings, and CSS.

## Solution

Removed the redundant sidebar markup from the server-rendered HTML. Cleaned up related client-side code by deleting chip query/handlers and removed unused CSS selectors for stats/chips/hint.

## Prevention

- Keep sidebar content focused on core value proposition only.
- When removing UI elements, also remove related JS listeners and CSS blocks in the same change.
- Add a simple UI snapshot/assertion test for home layout sections.
