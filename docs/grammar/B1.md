# B1 Grammar Plan (Speaking First)

## 1. Perfect and Continuous Control
- Present Perfect (`for/since`, life experience)
- Present Perfect vs Past Simple
- Past Continuous (`was/were + -ing`)
- Past Continuous + Past Simple (`when/while`)

## 2. Future and Hypothesis
- Future Continuous (intro)
- First Conditional (real future)
- Second Conditional (unreal present/future)
- Conditionals with `unless`

## 3. Modal System Expansion
- `may/might/could` for possibility
- `must/can't` for deduction (basic)
- `should/ought to` nuances
- `had better` (practical advice)

## 4. Verb Patterns
- Gerund vs infinitive (`like doing`, `want to do`)
- Common pattern verbs: `enjoy, avoid, decide, suggest`
- Causative `have/get` (intro): `I had my phone repaired`

## 5. Relative Clauses and Linking
- Defining relative clauses (`who/which/that`)
- Relative clauses with `where/when`
- Clause linking: `if, when, because, although, so`

## 6. Report and Interaction Grammar
- Reported statements (intro tense shift)
- Reported questions (basic)
- Question tags (intro): `isn't it?`

## 7. Discourse Tools for Speaking
- Opinion framing: `I think`, `In my view`
- Softening: `maybe`, `kind of`, `a bit`
- Clarification: `What I mean is...`

## 8. Speaking Outcomes (B1)
- Tell connected stories with time clarity
- Explain reasons and consequences
- Handle problem-solution discussions
- Hold structured conversation for 8-10 minutes
