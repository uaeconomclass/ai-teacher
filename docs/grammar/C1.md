# C1 Grammar Plan (Speaking First)

## 1. High-Precision Clause Control
- Reduced relative clauses
- Advanced participle clauses (`Having done..., Given...`)
- Cleft sentences (`What I need is...`, `It was X that...`)
- Inversion after negatives (`Rarely have I...`)

## 2. Advanced Modality and Stance
- Epistemic vs deontic modality
- Layered hedging (`would seem to`, `may well`, `tends to`)
- Strength control for claims (`highly likely`, `arguably`)

## 3. Sophisticated Conditionality
- Inverted conditionals (`Had I known...`)
- Alternative conditional structures (`provided that`, `as long as`)
- Counterfactual chains in argumentation

## 4. Discourse Grammar for Professional Speaking
- Signposting structures (`To begin with`, `That said`, `Overall`)
- Framing and concession blocks
- Embedded clauses for nuance and precision
- Nominalization in formal register (spoken-academic use)

## 5. Reported and Reframed Communication
- Distancing language (`He is said to...`)
- Advanced reporting verbs with patterns
- Attribution and source framing in discussion

## 6. Register and Style Shifting
- Formal vs neutral grammar choices
- Politeness softening for disagreement
- Compact vs expanded sentence strategies

## 7. Speaking Outcomes (C1)
- Deliver structured mini-presentations with Q&A
- Build nuanced arguments with caveats
- Shift style by audience and context
- Sustain complex discussion with precision
