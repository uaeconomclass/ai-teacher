# Grammar Roadmap (Speaking Priority)

This folder contains a full CEFR grammar roadmap split by level for a speaking-first platform.

## Files
- `docs/grammar/A1.md`
- `docs/grammar/A2.md`
- `docs/grammar/B1.md`
- `docs/grammar/B2.md`
- `docs/grammar/C1.md`
- `docs/grammar/C2.md`

## Design Principles
- Grammar is taught as conversation tooling, not abstract theory.
- Each unit goes: pattern -> drill -> role-play -> free speaking.
- Move forward only after spoken mastery, not only quiz score.

## Cross-Level Flow
1. A1-A2: survival speech and clean sentence building.
2. B1-B2: narrative control, argumentation, and interaction repair.
3. C1-C2: precision, nuance, register control, and rhetorical flexibility.
